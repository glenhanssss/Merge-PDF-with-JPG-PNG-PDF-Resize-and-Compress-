# Merge-PDF-with-JPG-PNG-PDF-Resize-and-Compress

- main.py is selecting files for PDF, JPG, PNG then Resize and Converting JPG + PNG to PDF (save the process file in local file) then merged all the PDF selected files and convert it to PDF output
- main_3.py is same as before BUT the process file is not saved in the local file, it runs all Resize-Converting process in MEMORY and then merged all the PDF selected files and convert it to PDF output
- main_4.py is same as before but it will not Resize the selected Landscape images to Portrait, it will stay as the original size which is Landscape [THIS IS THE BEST SCRIPT SO FAR]
